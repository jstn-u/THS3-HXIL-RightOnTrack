## Thesis Overview
This study develops MAGNN-LSTM-MTL, a hybrid deep learning model for estimating train travel times in urban rail transit systems, applied to real-world operational data from the Canberra Metro Light Rail Transit system in Australia — a 14-station, 12-kilometer corridor spanning Gungahlin Place to Alinga Street. Conventional travel time estimation models rely on fixed schedules and distance-based calculations that fail to capture the dynamic factors governing actual train operations, including station dwell times, operational arrival and departure delays, cascading network congestion, and weather conditions. The proposed pipeline addresses this by integrating three complementary components: a Multi-Attention Graph Neural Network (MAGNN) that models the rail network as a multi-view weighted graph to capture how delays propagate spatially across stations, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) residual corrector that learns temporal patterns in travel time fluctuations, and a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) head with a learned bias correction mechanism that explicitly suppresses the error accumulation problem inherent in segment-by-segment prediction. This produces reliable full-trip duration estimates from a hierarchical, operationally-grounded architecture.

This repository implements an end‑to‑end spatiotemporal learning pipeline for rail/transit travel‑time modeling. The core workflow is:

1) Load GPS + operational + weather datasets (train/val/test)
2) Cluster “stop / dwell / slowdown” locations (multiple algorithms supported)
3) Convert raw GPS traces into **segments** (origin→destination pairs) with engineered context features
4) Build **graph adjacency matrices** over segment types (geo / distance / social)
5) Train and evaluate MAGNN/MAGTTE + LSTM multi‑task variants
6) Export metrics, plots, and timing comparisons into `outputs/`

## Repository structure

Top-level modules:

- `main.py`
  - Primary end‑to‑end pipeline for a single clustering method.
- `compare_algorithms.py`
  - Runs multiple clustering algorithms and produces a unified comparison (metrics + timing).
- `test_clusters.py`
  - Cluster/method experimentation harness (historically used for sweeps).

Core pipeline modules:

- `config.py`
  - Shared configuration, printing helpers (`print_section`), distance helpers (`haversine_meters`), device selection.
- `data_loader.py`
  - CSV loading, chronological sorting/sampling, and known-stop extraction.
- `segments.py`
  - Convert raw GPS pings into segment records and build adjacency matrices over segment types.
- `visualizations.py`
  - Cluster plots, segment plots, and summary plots.

Modeling modules:

- `model.py`
  - Dataset/dataloader utilities, training loop(s), evaluation utilities, and MAGNN/MAGTTE model definitions.
- `mtl.py`
  - Multi‑task learning heads, loss functions, and hierarchical trip prediction components.
- `residual.py`
  - Station/cluster mapping, nearest‑GPS feature lookup, and residual modeling utilities.

Clustering adapters (all expose the same public API):

- `cluster_hdbscan.py`
- `cluster_dbscan.py`
- `cluster_kmeans.py`
- `cluster_gmm.py`
- `cluster_knn.py`

Data / outputs folders:

- `data/` – expected CSV inputs
- `outputs/` – run artifacts (plots, metrics JSON, comparisons)
- `DeepTTE/` – optional baseline model folder (separate pipeline)

---

## Data

### Input files

Expected CSVs (default locations):

- `data/train_data.csv`
- `data/validation_data.csv`
- `data/test_data.csv`
- `data/social_function.csv` (used to build the social adjacency matrix)

The loader expects at minimum:

- Geographic coordinates: `latitude`, `longitude`
- A timestamp column (used for chronological sorting; exact name depends on your loader configuration)

Many parts of the pipeline use optional columns when present:

- Motion/event indicators: `speed_mps`, `is_long_dwell`, `is_slow_speed`, `is_slowdown`
- Delay/operations: `arrivalDelay`, `departureDelay`, `dwellTime_sec`
- Weather: columns like `temperature_2m`, `windspeed_10m`, etc.
- Categorical/binary context: `is_weekend`, `is_peak_hour`

If a required column is missing for a stage, that stage will either fall back to a default behavior or drop the feature (depends on the function).

## Clustering layer (`cluster_*.py`)

### Unified adapter API

Each clustering module must expose:

```python
event_driven_clustering_fixed(df, known_stops=None, **optional)
	-> (cluster_centers: np.ndarray shape (N,2),
		station_cluster_ids: set[int])
```

- `cluster_centers[i] = [lat, lon]`
- `station_cluster_ids` indicates which indices in `cluster_centers` correspond to known physical stations (only used by some algorithms).

This shared API allows `main.py` and `compare_algorithms.py` to switch clustering algorithms without changing downstream code.

### Algorithm notes

- **DBSCAN (`cluster_dbscan.py`)**
  - Fully data‑driven number of clusters.
  - Uses a k‑distance elbow method to select `eps`.
  - Ignores `known_stops` (prints a note).
- **KMEANS (`cluster_kmeans.py`)**
  - Uses a default `n_clusters` inside the module.
  - Ignores `known_stops`.
- **GMM (`cluster_gmm.py`)**
  - Uses a default `n_components` / `n_clusters` inside the module.
  - Ignores `known_stops`.
- **HDBSCAN (`cluster_hdbscan.py`)**
  - Density‑based with optional station injection/merging.
  - Requires the `hdbscan` Python package.
- **KNN (`cluster_knn.py`)**
  - Graph clustering of sparse delay/stop events with station injection.

## Segmentation (`segments.py`)

Segmentation converts raw GPS points into **origin→destination segments**. 

Key steps:
1. Assign each GPS ping to the nearest cluster (within a configured radius).
2. Identify segment boundaries when the assigned cluster changes OR when authoritative stop metadata indicates a stop sequence transition.
3. Aggregate per-segment features:
   - Target: `duration_sec` (from origin to destination)
   - Operational features (delays, dwell)
   - Weather features
   - Binary flags: weekend/peak hour and event flags

Segmentation is executed for train/val/test and produces a segment dataframe plus a “segment type” encoding used for the graph.

---

## Adjacency matrices / graph construction

`segments.py` builds adjacency matrices over **segment types**. 

Common matrices:

- `adj_geo`: geographic similarity between segment types
- `adj_dist`: connectivity/transition similarity
- `adj_soc`: social-function similarity (based on `data/social_function.csv`)

These matrices are used by graph layers in MAGNN/MAGTTE.

---

## Modeling

### Core model utilities (`model.py`)

`model.py` contains most of the training/evaluation utilities and model definitions. It typically provides:

- Dataset / dataloader wrappers
- Model construction (MAGTTE + graph attention components)
- Training loops (epoch iteration, checkpointing)
- Evaluation helpers returning regression metrics and predictions

### Multi-task learning (`mtl.py`)

`mtl.py` contains components for multi‑task learning such as:

- Multi‑head prediction (e.g., per‑segment + per‑trip)
- Combined loss functions
- Sequence encoders (LSTM) and hierarchical predictors

### Residual / station mapping (`residual.py`)

Utilities for mapping anonymous clusters to known stations and constructing residual features via nearest‑neighbour lookups.

---

## Training & evaluation

Training flow:

1. Build segments + adjacency
2. Create datasets/dataloaders
3. Train for `epochs`
4. Evaluate (train/val/test)
5. Save `metrics.json` + plots

Evaluation returns:

- `loss`
- `r2`, `rmse`, `mae`, `mape`
---

## Inference timing metrics

Timing metrics are intended to separate:

- **Pure model forward time** (batch forward pass)
- **Total inference time** (entire test set)
- **Clustering overhead**
- Derived throughput/latency
- **Total pipeline time** (end‑to‑end)

Standard keys used in comparisons:

- `avg_model_forward_ms`
- `total_inference_time_s`
- `clustering_time_ms`
- `throughput_samples_per_sec`
- `avg_latency_per_sample_ms`
- `total_pipeline_time_ms`

These are surfaced in per‑algorithm `metrics.json` and aggregate comparison CSV/JSON.

---

## Outputs & file formats

All artifacts are written under `outputs/`.

Common patterns:

- Single algorithm run:
  - `outputs/<ALGO>_<timestamp>_i1/`
- Algorithm comparison run:
  - `outputs/algorithm_comparison_<timestamp>/`
	- `KMEANS/metrics.json`, `KNN/metrics.json`, ...
	- `comparison_results.csv`
	- `comparison_results.json`

Per algorithm, expected artifacts should include:

- `metrics.json`
- `*-clusters.png`
- `*-segments.png`
- `*-segment_stats.png`

### `metrics.json` 


```json
{
  "config": { "algorithm": "KMEANS", "sample_fraction": 1.0, "epochs": 50, "batch_size": 64 },
  "results": { "Train": {"r2": 0.0}, "Val": {"r2": 0.0}, "Test": {"r2": 0.0, "inference_timing": { /* ... */ } } },
  "timing": {
	"clustering_time_ms": 0.0,
	"total_pipeline_time_ms": 0.0
  }
}
```

## Experiment runners

### `main.py`

Runs a single clustering method end‑to‑end.

Typical usage:

```bash
python main.py <sample_fraction> <clustering algorithm>
python main.py 0.1                    # 10% random sample, hdbscan
python main.py 1.0 knn                # 100% sample, KNN
python main.py 0.5 dbscan             # 50% sample, DBSCAN
python main.py --compare-all          # three-way model comparison
python main.py --ablation             # feature ablation study
python main.py 0.1 knn --compare-all  # all options combined
python main.py 0.1 knn --ablation     # all options combined
```

Where the second argument is usually `sample_fraction`.

### `compare_algorithms.py`

Runs multiple clustering algorithms in one experiment folder and aggregates results.

```bash
python compare_algorithms.py 1.0
```

Depending on your branch/version, it may support:

- `--resume` to skip algorithms that already have completed `metrics.json`
- `--run-folder <path>` to continue in an existing output folder

### `test_clusters.py`

Used for targeted cluster experiments and debugging. If you want it to run the *full MAGNN‑LSTM‑MTL pipeline for all clusters* (rather than cluster-size sweeps), treat it as a convenience wrapper around the same pipeline functions used by `main.py`.

```bash
    python test_clusters.py                  # defaults from config
    python test_clusters.py 0.1              # 10% sample fraction
    python test_clusters.py 0.15             # 15% sample fraction
```
## Troubleshooting

- **It’s running on 20% instead of 100%**
  - Ensure you invoked `sample_fraction=1.0`.
  - Confirm the script you ran actually parses that argument as `sample_fraction`.
  - Ensure you didn’t resume from a folder created with 0.2 earlier.

- **HDBSCAN killed / OOM**
  - HDBSCAN can be memory heavy on large event sets.
  - Consider sampling fraction, reducing event points, or running on a larger machine.

- **Resume marked an incomplete run as complete**
  - Resume logic should validate the contents of `metrics.json`, not just its presence.
